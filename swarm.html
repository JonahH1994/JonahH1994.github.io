	  <p> In this project, I took a HexBug Spider and hacked it to incorporate an ESP8266 microcontroller so that commands could be sent over WiFi. By including this microcontroller, I needed to tap into the onboard motor controller to route commands from the ESP8266 to the HexBug. The code for the ESP8266 was written in arduino. To control the HexBug, commands were sent through a python script. The script first establishes a UDP connection with the HexBug and then sends forward, backward, right, left, right forward, left forward, and stop. The main script however runs a swarm configuration given below:
	  </p>
	  <center><img src="img/swarm_config.jpg" alt=""></center>
	  <p> The configuration works as follows, each group moves from one of the 3 smaller boxes to another with all groups having to be within the designated box before the entire swarm is able to continue. The larger outer bounding box signfies the boundaries of the bots. 
	  </p>
	  <p> To avoid collisions with each other, control barrier certificates were used to find the optimal motion direction that minimizes deviation from movement towards the goal position. More on how control barrier functions work can be found  
	   <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4e18/b03049b5e743d7a66eec4dabc81084429e02.pdf?_ga=2.98278556.265347371.1546588167-303566410.1544748684">here.</a> The control barrier certificates ended up being all that was needed for the motion planning of the bots since it would drive the bots toward the goal with and without obstacles in the field. 
	  </p>
	  <p> Finally, localization was done using a vicon Motion Caption System in the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at Cornell University. To do this, vicon balls needed to be attached to the top of each HexBug in a unique configuration. This enabled the system to be able to distinguish between each bot.  
	  </p>
	  <p> With the exception of the localization, this system is fully decentralized as each bot makes decisions on its own. This is because each bot is essentially a node on the main computer that runs the stack. Thus, each bot only has information about itself and bots that are within a certain vicinity of them.
